# Smart Headboard Project

## Overview
This project implements a smart headboard system with integrated electronics that can perform face recognition, voice interactions, and control LED lights. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi and interfaces with various peripherals and online services.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition for user identification.
- Voice synthesis and speech to text for interactive communication.
- Control of addressable LED lights for ambient effects.
- Audio output management for alarms, notifications, and media playback.
- Device communication to interact with smart devices and TVs.
- GUI for system control and status display.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute `main.py` to start the application.

## Usage
After starting the application, the system will be ready to receive voice commands, recognize registered users via the camera, and control LEDs and audio output based on user interactions.

## Components
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
- `face_recognition.py`: Handles face detection and recognition logic.
- `voice_synthesis.py`: Converts text to speech.
- `speech_to_text.py`: Converts spoken words to text.
- `llm_handler.py`: Manages interaction with pre-trained large language models.
- `led_controller.py`: Controls addressable LED lights.
- `audio_output.py`: Manages audio playback through speakers.
- `device_communication.py`: Communicates with other smart devices and TVs.
- `chatbot.py`: Processes user input and responds to commands.
- `gui_handler.py`: Manages the graphical user interface.
